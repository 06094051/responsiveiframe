    <h4>Getting Started</h4>
    
    <p>ResponsiveIframe is a tiny jQuery plugin developed at NPR to make IFrames be Responsive.</p>
    
    <p>Due to browser security you will have to include our Javascript file both in the "parent" page, as well
       as in the page being embedded through an iframe. The Parent page will also have to include latest jQuery.
       There is no dependency on jQuery for the child page functionality.</p>
